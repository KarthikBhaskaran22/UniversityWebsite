      <p>
        WHY REVA? <br>
        Digital-First REVA -
        In 2016, when traditional teaching-learning methods were the only way of learning, REVA University envisioned the need to adopt future-ready, technology-based learning, and accordingly, a foundation was laid to build the necessary technological infrastructure. At the REVA Digital Summit, in the same year, a five-year plan was chalked out to make tech-driven learning a reality. In 2020, when the landscape of education changed, and Blended Learning became the new normal, REVA University was ahead of time and transitioned to online classes in less than 3 days. While we are enabled to conduct 100% online classes and digital examinations, the University is constantly striving to adopt modern methods that will enrich the learning experience for students at REVA University. The ethos of REVA University is driven to be future-ready and offer exemplary academic experience. The academic infrastructure at the University further boosts our mission.
